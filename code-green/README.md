## Code Green: Hacking on Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative datasets

Code Green is both a hackathon and workshop at re:Invent 2019, held Thursday 12/5 from 1-5pm, centered around exploring Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) datasets. Both the hack and the workshop will take place concurrently in the same space, and attendees can choose which path they want to follow. If you're attending re:Invent, you can register for the session [here](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=99788&csrftkn=3SUA-ISXO-ZSNY-YOY0-5EJH-E7K8-ASEI-D66U).

### Hackathon
Individual - or groups of two to five - hackers work on projects during the course of re:Invent. Any ASDI dataset can be used. In particular, check out the ASDI weather and climate datasets. APIs, visualization tools, combinations of datasets into something new - all fair game. Entries should be submitted open-source GitHub repos, and time permitting teams will be giving project demos toward the end of the event.

To help you get started check out this [overview of suitable climate and weather datasets](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-asdi/tree/master/code-green/datasets). Or for the full selection of eligible datasets, view the [full list on the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative](https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/sustainability/).

### Workshop
Want to participate without competing? An ASDI workshop runs concurrently during the event Thursday, in which participants build a functioning API to use ASDI datasets to make decisions using sustainability data. Facilitators will be there to help, and code for the workshop will be posted to this repo before the event.

### Swag and prizes

Code Green is purchasing carbon offsets for travel to re:Invent by all registered hackathon participants; hackathon winners receive free passes to re:Invent 2020. The real winner? Earth, of course.
